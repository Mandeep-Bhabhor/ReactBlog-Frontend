# 📝 Full-Stack Blog Application

A complete blog application built as part of my React learning journey. This project connects a **React.js frontend** with a **Laravel backend** and stores data in a **MySQL** database.

It supports blog creation and viewing, and I'm actively working on features like update, delete, and user authentication.
